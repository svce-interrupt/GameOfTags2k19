	<h1>ABOUT US</h1>
	<p>
	Allways is a non-profit private organization that was found in late 2005 by two unknown teenagers who wished to help those in need of aid.
	It was started in a newly renovated 50 sq ft storeroom on the 10th floor of bradford towers where people walked in to donate money 
	for those who were affected by the hurricane Katrina.


	A few years later when the teengers were unable to keep the organization running, it was brought by Yahoo in 2010 and kept up till date 
	as not only a donation camp but also as an awareness site that people visit to check what calamity has recently hit in which corner of the world
	and they get to donate to the disaster irrespective of the place they are from.

	Allways now has over  400 employees working full time and a 1000+ volunteers who show up for field work. 
	in 2012, Allways generated over 80million dollars and donated the entire amount for the relief operations of Hurricane Sandy, thus 
	becoming the organization with the highest contributor for the disaster.
