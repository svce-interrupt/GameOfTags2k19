                        <p>Water pollution is the contamination of water bodies, usually as a result of human
                            activities. Water bodies include for example lakes, rivers, oceans, aquifers and
                            groundwater. Water pollution results when contaminants are introduced into the natural
                            environment. For example, releasing inadequately treated wastewater into natural water
                            bodies can lead to degradation of aquatic ecosystems. In turn, this can lead to public
                            health problems for people living downstream. They may use the same polluted river water for
                            drinking or bathing or irrigation. Water pollution is the leading worldwide cause of death
                            and disease, e.g. due to water-borne diseases.[1][2]

                            Water pollution can be grouped into surface water pollution. Marine pollution and nutrient
                            pollution are subsets of water pollution. Sources of water pollution are either point
                            sources and non-point sources. Point sources have one identifiable cause of the pollution,
                            such as a storm drain, wastewater treatment plant or stream. Non-point sources are more
                            diffuse, such as agricultural runoff.[3] Pollution is the result of the cumulative effect
                            over time. All plants and organisms living in or being exposed to polluted water bodies can
                            be impacted. The effects can damage individual species and impact the natural biological
                            communities they are part of.</p>
