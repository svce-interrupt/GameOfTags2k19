                                    <p>Air pollution occurs when harmful or excessive quantities of substances including gases, particles, and biological molecules are introduced into Earth's atmosphere. It may cause diseases, allergies and even death to humans; it may also cause harm to other living organisms such as animals and food crops, and may damage the natural or built environment. Both human activity and natural processes can generate air pollution.

                                            Indoor air pollution and poor urban air quality are listed as two of the world's worst toxic pollution problems in the 2008 Blacksmith Institute World's Worst Polluted Places report.[1] Outdoor air pollution alone causes 2.1[2][3] to 4.21 million premature deaths annually.[4][5] According to the 2014 World Health Organization report, air pollution in 2012 caused the deaths of around 7 million people worldwide,[4] an estimate roughly echoed by the International Energy Agency.[6][7]</p>
