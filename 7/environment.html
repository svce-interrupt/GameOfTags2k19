      <h2><b>Belunga strurgen</b></h2>
    </div>
<b><p id="txt">While the beluga sturgeon is popular for its fillets, its eggs, known as "true caviar," are regarded as a delicacy. Native to the Caspian Sea, these ancient fish can grow to 15 feet in length, weigh more than a ton and live to be 100 years old. Due to the popularity of their eggs, they're heavily overfished -- typically with gill nets. This particularly problematic because this species that doesn't reach sexual maturity until 20 or 25 years of age. In addition to fishing pressures, beluga sturgeon suffer from habitat reduction, having lost 90 percent of their historic spawning grounds over the past several decades. Because of these pressures, the IUCN classified the beluga sturgeon as endangered, and the population is expected to continue its decline.

      <h2><b>Atlantic Halibut</b></h2>
    </div>
 <b><p id="txt">Found in the North Atlantic Ocean, the Atlantic halibut is the largest of the flat fish species. Boasting a 50-year lifespan, it can reach a length of 9 feet and weigh up to 1,000 pounds. But because this slow-growing fish doesn't become sexually mature until it's 10 to 14 years old, it's particularly susceptible to overfishing. While Atlantic halibut are normally caught with hooks-and-lines, they're often caught as bycatch in bottom trawl fisheries. The IUCN classifies them as endangered, and their numbers are not expected recover in the near future. This has prompted the United States to ban Atlantic halibut fishing in its coastal waters.    </p>

      <h2>Acadian redfish</h2>
    </div>
	
<p id="txt"><b>This species of North Atlantic fish grows to about 20 inches in length and can live as long as 50 years. Like other overfished species, the Acadian redfish is slow-growing and reaches reproductive age late -- at about eight or nine years old. Intensive trawling over the last 10 years has led to the smallest yields since commercial fishing of the species commenced in the 1930s. Worse, the Acadian redfish has been subject to pirate fishing, or fishing done in violation of environmental law. For these reasons, the IUCN lists the species as endangered.

      <h2>Orange Roughy </h2>
    </div>
 <p id="txt"><b>Also known as the "slimehead," the orange roughy has a wide-ranging habitat that includes the coasts of New Zealand, Australia, Namibia and the northeast Atlantic Ocean. Its life expectancy is up to 149 years, and it reaches sexual maturation age between 20 and 32 years, making it the epitome of a species inherently vulnerable to overfishing. The pressure of overfishing is amplified by fishermen's tendency to trawl for orange roughy when the fish congregate to feed and breed. The resulting catches wipe out generations. Though the IUCN hasn't reviewed this species to determine if it is endangered, a number of other organizations have recognized the significant decline in its numbers after only 25 years of commercial harvesting.

      <h2 style="font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;" >Winter Skate  </h2>
    </div>
<p id="txt"><b> The winter skate is a fascinating species known to deter predators and stun prey with a quick jolt of electricity. Most are found in the northwest Atlantic Ocean, from the Gulf of St. Lawrence in Canada to North Carolina in the United States. Once thought to be a "trash fish," the winter skate is now harvested and processed into fishmeal and lobster bait, and is even marketed for human consumption. Increased trawling for the species has resulted in the accidental capture of juveniles, which are easily mistaken for smaller, more abundant species. This has led to a staggering population decline among winter skate, which are slow to reach sexual maturity and have few offspring. Experts blame these factors for a 90 percent reduction in mature individuals since the 1970s. This devastating decline has earned the winter skate a critically endangered rating from the IUCN.</b> </p>
