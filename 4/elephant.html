    <h1>Forest elephants defend against climate change by promoting carbon-storing trees, study says</h1>

    <p>Poaching destabilises nations, disrupts ecosystems and threatens biodiversity. A recent study suggests still another consequence: Some types of poaching may also accelerate climate change.

        Forest elephants – the smaller, endangered relatives of African savanna elephants – promote the growth of large trees that excel at storing carbon, according to research published in the journal Nature Geoscience.
        
        Should forest elephants disappear, scientists estimated, Central Africa’s rainforest will lose about 3 billion tons of carbon – the equivalent of France’s total CO2 emissions for 27 years.</p>
        <br>
        <p>“This new paper points to something that we in Central Africa have suspected for a long time, but now this group has thrown some serious science at the issue,” said Fiona Maisels, a conservation scientist at the Wildlife Conservation Society and at the University of Stirling in Scotland.

            <p>Over recent years, researchers have gained a more detailed understanding of the links between animals and climate. 

                Wild grazers, for instance, can reduce the intensity and frequency of fires that emit greenhouse gases. Methane emissions from livestock significantly contribute to global warming.
                
                Scientists have also known for decades that large herbivores such as elephants play important short-term roles in ecosystems by promoting biodiversity, recycling nutrients and dispersing seeds.
